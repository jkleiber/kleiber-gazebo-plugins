# Justin Kleiber Robotics Simulator

I'm Justin Kleiber and this is my robotics simulator. I work here with my old man and my son, Big Bot. Everything in here has a story, but no price. One thing I've learned over the years - you never know when a robot is going to work. Unless you simulate it that is!

This simulator repository seeks to maintain a set of models, plugins, and worlds that I use in my robotics projects.

## Available Robots

Currently there is one robot available for simulation

1. Six wheel robot

More robots will be added in the future.


## Installation
1. You may need to install the following dependencies
```
sudo apt-get install -y libignition-rendering3-dev libignition-common3-graphics-dev 
```


## Compatibility

This has only been tested in Gazebo 11, but probably works in earlier versions.
